<ul>
    <li>What characters are allowed in a URL?</li>
        <p>The character allowed are generally, alphanumeric characters and the plus (+), period (.), and hyphen (-) symbols are allowed.</p>
    <li>What happens if you try to create a URL /tim gunn</li>
        <p>There will be an error on the page and it will say cannot get</p>
    <li>Is there a difference between /timgunn and /TimGunn and /tim/gunn?</li>
        <p> "/timgunn": This represents a single path segment in the URL. It could be interpreted as a resource or endpoint within the domain. The segment is case-sensitive, so "/timgunn" is not the same as "/TimGunn" or "/TIMGUNN."

            "/TimGunn": Similar to the previous example, "/TimGunn" represents a different path segment from "/timgunn." The segment is case-sensitive, so it is considered distinct from other variations.
            
            "/tim/gunn": This URL represents two path segments, "tim" and "gunn," separated by a forward slash (/). In this case, the segment "tim" is distinct from "Tim" or "timgunn," and "gunn" is also distinct from other variations.
            
            In general, URLs are case-sensitive, meaning that different letter casing (uppercase vs. lowercase) will result in different URLs. Additionally, the presence or absence of forward slashes (/) within the path affects the structure and interpretation of the URL.
        </p>
    <li>If you have a phrase like Here's looking at you, kid, how do you deal with the ' in Here's?</li>
        <p>It makes no difference when using double quotes but if you're using single quotes a "\" will replace the apostrophe.</p>
</ul>
